Hello everyone! 
I'm excited to share my first published Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, on Airbnb (#ABNB). 
I'd love to hear your feedback and constructive criticism. 
If you enjoy my work and thought what you found is interesting, please follow me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/arlabossecasimir).

This DCF model aims to provide insights into Airbnb's valuation by considering factors like revenue growth, operating margin, and capital expenditures. I understand there's room for improvement, and your suggestions will help refine this model and contribute to my growth and future models.

With kind regards,
Casimir
